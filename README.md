# tel
Tel is a Discord bot I created to help me and my friends on Discord, to learn more about programming, and most importantly, to have fun.
A few npm packages are needed to use this bot, which can be installed with the command `npm install package_name_here`. It includes discord.js, node-fetch@2, jssoup, cheerio, and html-to-text.
Insert the bot's token inside config.json to use the bot.
This is my first time using github and I apologize if anything does not work. Feel free to let me know if anything deos not work.
